As a practicing attorney, DiFiore worked in a law firm and in the Westchester District Attorney's Office. DiFiore then was elected a judge of the Westchester County Court, and was subsequently named a justice on the New York Supreme Court (the state trial court in New York), serving in that post from 2003 to 2005.

It is the newest bridge across the East River and was built to relieve traffic on the Bronx-Whitestone Bridge 2 miles to the west, which opened in 1939. The Throgs Neck Bridge is the easternmost crossing off of Long Island.

Through New Jersey, I-287 runs west from its southern terminus in Edison through suburban areas. In Bridgewater Township, the freeway takes a more northeasterly course, paralleled by U.S. Route\u00a0202 (US\u00a0202). The northernmost part of I-287 in New Jersey passes through mountainous surroundings. After crossing into New York at Suffern, I-287 turns east on the New York State Thruway (I-87) and runs though Rockland County. After crossing the Hudson River on the Tappan Zee Bridge, I-287 splits from I-87 near Tarrytown and continues east through Westchester County on the Cross-Westchester Expressway until it reaches the New England Thruway.", "West Gate Tunnel": "The West Gate Tunnel, originally known as the Western Distributor, is a proposed 5 kilometre toll road in Melbourne, Australia, to link the West Gate Freeway at Yarraville with CityLink at Docklands via a tunnel beneath Yarraville. The $5.5\u00a0billion project was proposed by infrastructure company Transurban in 2014 as a means of alleviating congestion on the M1 corridor, providing a new river crossing as an alternative to the West Gate Bridge and moving trucks away from homes in the city's inner west. The freeway-standard link would include a 1.5\u00a0km-long, six-lane tunnel and a new bridge over the Maribyrnong River. The Victorian government announced in December 2015 it would proceed with the project. Major construction of the tunnel and elevated tollway is scheduled to begin in early 2018 and be completed in 2022."}}, {"q_id": "5a8ec67d5542995a26add512", "titles": ["Khalifa Jassim Al-Kuwari"],

the lack of native trees on the island. As a result, grass- and turf-covered houses were developed. Later on, the Swiss chalet style became a prevailing influence in Icelandic architecture as many timber buildings were constructed in this way. Stone and later concrete were popular building materials, the latter especially with the arrival of functionalism in the country. Contemporary architecture in Iceland is influenced by many sources, with styles varying greatly around the country.", "Documentary hypothesis": "The documentary hypothesis (DH) is one of three models used to explain the origins and composition of the first five books of the Bible, called collectively the Torah or Pentateuch, the other two being the supplementary hypothesis and the fragmentary hypothesis. All three agree that the Torah is not a unified work from a single author (traditionally Moses) but is made up of sources combined over many centuries by many hands. They differ on the nature of these sources and how they were combined. According to the documentary hypothesis there were four sources, each originally a separate and independent book (a \"document\"), joined together at various points in time by a series of editors (\"redactors\"). Fragmentary hypotheses see the Torah as a collection of small fragments, and supplementary hypotheses as a single core document supplemented by fragments taken from many sources.", "Constitution of Liberia": "The Constitution of Liberia is the supreme law of the Republic of Liberia. The current constitution, which came into force on 6 January 1986, replaced the Liberian Constitution of 1847, which had been in force since the independence of Liberia. Much like the 1847 Constitution, the Constitution creates a system of government heavily modeled on the Federal Government of the United States.", "Fundamental rights in India": "Fundamental Rights are the basic rights of the people and the charter of rights contained in of Constitution of India. It guarantees civil liberties such that all Indians can lead their lives in peace and harmony as citizens of India. These include individual rights common to most liberal democracies, such as equality before law, freedom of speech and expression, religious and cultural freedom and peaceful assembly, freedom to practice religion, and the right to constitutional remedies for the protection of civil rights by means of writs such as habeas corpus, Mandamus, Prohibition, Certiorariand Quo Warranto. Violation of these rights result in punishments as prescribed in the Indian Penal Code or other special laws, subject to discretion of the judiciary. The Fundamental Rights are defined as basic human freedoms that every Indian citizen has the right to enjoy for a proper and harmonious development of personality. These rights universally apply to all citizens, irrespective of race, place of birth, religion, caste or gender. Aliens (persons who are not citizens) are also considered in matters like equality before law. They are enforceable by the courts, subject to certain restrictions. Though the rights conferred by the constitution other than fundamental rights are equally valid, their enforcement in case of violation shall be secured from the judiciary in a time consuming legal process.

A written constitution, the text which took effect on 9 August 1965 is derived from the Constitution of the State of Singapore 1963, provisions of the Federal Constitution of Malaysia made applicable to Singapore by the Republic of Singapore Independence Act 1965 (No.\u00a09 of 1965, 1985\u00a0Rev. Ed.) , and the Republic of Singapore Independence Act itself. The text of the Constitution is one of the legally binding sources of constitutional law in Singapore, the others being judicial interpretations of the Constitution, and certain other statutes. Non-binding sources are influences on constitutional law such as soft law, constitutional conventions, and public international law.", "Constitution of the Kingdom of Westphalia": "The Constitution of the Kingdom of Westphalia, was adopted by the Kingdom of Westphalia in 1807, following the pattern of the other Napoleonic States. The Constitution of the Kingdom of Westphalia is the oldest constitution in Germany. It was modeled on the constitutions of other Napoleonic States (e.g., the highest organization of the patent Constitution of the Grand Duchy of Frankfurt). The Constitution was by royal decree dated on 7 December 1807 and enacted in law bulletin."}}, {"q_id": "5a73cc9055429905862fe0c2", "titles": ["Russian battlecruiser Pyotr Velikiy"], "probs": [{"EOE":

In particular there is natural definition of the determinant for them and most linear algebra theorems like Cramer's rule, Cayley\u2013Hamilton theorem, etc. hold true for them.

These matrices have applications in representation theory in particular to Capelli's identity, Yangian and quantum integrable systems.", "Quantum computing": "Quantum computing studies computation systems (quantum computers) that make direct use of quantum-mechanical phenomena, such as superposition and entanglement, to perform operations on data. Quantum computers are different from binary digital electronic computers based on transistors. Whereas common digital computing requires that the data be encoded into binary digits (bits), each of which is always in one of two definite states (0 or 1), quantum computation uses quantum bits, which can be in superpositions of states. A quantum Turing machine is a theoretical model of such a computer, and is also known as the universal quantum computer. The field of quantum computing was initiated by the work of Paul Benioff and Yuri Manin in 1980, Richard Feynman in 1982, and David Deutsch in 1985.

Novikov fought in the Spanish Civil War as a battalion commander. After returning to the Soviet Union he fought in the Winter War. After the end of the Winter War Novikov became commander of the 2nd Cavalry Division. He led the division in battles on the Southern Front. The division became the 109th Rifle Division and fought in the Siege of Sevastopol. After the evacuation of Filipp Oktyabrsky and Ivan Yefimovich Petrov, Novikov became commander of the Sevastopol defense. Novikov attempted to evacuate the city on a patrol boat and was intercepted and captured by German forces. He was sent to concentration camps in Germany and died at Flossenb\u00fcrg concentration camp in August 1944.", "Manin obstruction": "In mathematics, in the field of arithmetic algebraic geometry, the Manin obstruction (named after Yuri Manin) is attached to a variety \"X\" over a global field, which measures the failure of the Hasse principle for \"X\". If the value of the obstruction is non-trivial, then \"X\" may have points over all local fields but not over the global field.", "Quadratic algebra": "In mathematics, a quadratic algebra is a filtered algebra generated by degree one elements, with defining relations of degree 2.

corps of the United States Army Europe during the Cold War. Activated in 1918 for World War I, it was reactivated for World War II and again during the Cold War. During both World War II and the Cold War it was subordinate to the Seventh Army, or USAREUR and was headquartered at Kelley Barracks in Stuttgart, West Germany, from 1951 until it was redeployed to the US and inactivated in 1992.", "Aftermath of World War II": "The aftermath of World War II was the beginning of an era defined by the decline of the old great powers and the rise of two superpowers: the Soviet Union (USSR) and the United States of America (USA). Allied during World War II, the USA and the USSR became competitors on the world stage and engaged in the Cold War, so called because it never resulted in overt, declared hot war between the two powers but was instead characterized by espionage, political subversion and proxy wars. Western Europe and Japan were rebuilt through the American Marshall Plan whereas Eastern Europe fell under the Soviet sphere of influence and eventually an \"Iron Curtain\". Europe was divided into a US-led Western Bloc and a Soviet-led Eastern Bloc. Internationally, alliances with the two blocs gradually shifted, with some nations trying to stay out of the Cold War through the Non-Aligned Movement. The Cold War also saw a nuclear arms race between the two superpowers; part of the reason that the Cold War never became a \"hot\" war was that the Soviet Union and the United States had nuclear deterrents against each other, leading to a mutually assured destruction standoff.", "The Long, Twilight Struggle": "\"The Long, Twilight Struggle\" is an episode from the second season of the science fiction television series \"Babylon 5\".", "Cold War II": "Cold War II (also called the New Cold War, Second Cold War and Cold War 2.0) refers to a renewed state of political and military tension between opposing geopolitical power-blocs, with one bloc typically reported as being led by Russia and/or China, and the other led by the United States or NATO. This is akin to the original Cold War that saw a global confrontation between the Western Bloc led by the United States and the Eastern Bloc led by the Soviet Union, Russia's predecessor state. American political scientist Robert Legvold posits that the \"new Cold War began the moment we went over the cliff, and that happened with the Ukraine crisis.\" Others, such as Andrew C. Kuchins in 2016, believe that the term is \"unsuited to the present conflict,\" but the situation is arguably more dangerous than during the original Cold War. One of the primary features of the \"New Cold War\", as first defined by Philip N. Howard, is that conflict is experienced primarily over and through broadcast media, social media, and information infrastructure.", "List of military conflicts spanning multiple wars": "Early histories of a war typically describe the war as it was declared by the states involved. It is not uncommon for later historians to group together a series of wars over a long period or spread over several theaters as part of a broader conflict or strategic campaign. The most familiar of these in the present day is probably the Cold War and the War on Terror, which included the Korean War (1950\u20131953) (Cold War), the Vietnam War (1965\u20131973) (Cold War), the Persian Gulf War (1990\u20131991) (Cold War), the War in Afghanistan (2001\u20132016) (War on Terror), and the Iraq War (2003\u20132011) (War on Terror) to name these five wars during the Cold War and the War on Terror. These groupings provide useful context for the wars involved. Note that some groupings overlap time periods and its possible for more than one war to be going on at the same time.", "Mark Landler": "Mark Aurel Landler (born October 26, 1965 in Stuttgart, Germany) is an American journalist who has been a White House Correspondent for \"The New York Times\", based in Washington, D.C., since March 2011.

One major element of the Cold War was the threat of a nuclear war; another was espionage. Many works use the Cold War as a backdrop, or directly take part in fictional conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union The period 1953\u201362 saw Cold War themes first enter the mainstream culture as a public preoccupation.

When the concerto was first performed by Saint-Sa\u00ebns himself at the Leipzig Gewandhaus in 1869 it was not well received, possibly because of its harmonic experimentation. Saint-Sa\u00ebns's third concerto is not as often performed as his famous second concerto, or the fourth or fifth concertos, but it is still an important addition to the piano concerto repertoire.
